# get-music-from-yt

This script/program:

- reads vids (urls) from config.yaml (gitignored, but there's a config-example.yaml)
- picks the best audio quality
- downloads that audio
- converts that audio to mp3, named based on its config.yaml entry
- changes the tags (title, artist, etc) of the file, also based on config.yaml
